# Quizlet Match Solver

This is a program to win at Quizlet match using Selenium. I'm sure that there is a better way to do this, but I wanted to learn browser automation.

Currently, this works on text only sets on Linux with Geckodriver. You will have to modify the code slightly to work on Windows, MacOS, or with Chromium.

There is no fancy algorithm, it just looks up items in a dict. I'm sure there is a better way to do this, but I don't really care.
